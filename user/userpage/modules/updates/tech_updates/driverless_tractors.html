<h1 style="text-align:center;">DRIVERLESS TRACTORS</h1>
<div class="row">
	<div class="column left">
		<h2>What are they?</h2>
			As the name suggests, driverless tractors are farm vehicles that operate 
			without the presence of a human inside the tractor itself.
			They are programmed to independently observe their position, decide speed, 
			and avoid obstacles such as people, animals, or objects in the field while performing their task.
			They operate simply with the aid of a supervisor monitoring the progress remotely using an electronic device such as tablet.

        <h2>How they help?</h2>
			<ul>
			<li>They promote fatigue-free farming since the farmer does not have to 
			spend hours tilling the land.</li>
			<li>They also support all weather farming, be it summer or winter or rainy 
			since the farmer can control the vehicle while at a safe-space.
			It eliminates any health hazards that can be caused while handling the 
			chemical fertilizers and pesticides.</li>
			<li>They increase the efficiency of farming and hence give a better yield.</li>
			</ul>
		<h2>Cost?</h2>
			The cost depends on variants. However, theaverage cost of a driverless tractor
			in India is around Rs. 8,00,000 (It's only an expected price. Contact your 
			tractor dealer for the exact estimate).
