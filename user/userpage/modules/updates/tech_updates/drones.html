		<h2>What are they?</h2>
		<p>Agriculture drones are unmanned aerial vehicles used to help optimize 
		agriculture operations, increase crop production, manage livestock and 
		monitor crop growth.
		It erases the need for guesswork in modern farming and instead gives farmers 
		the ability to maximize their yields.</p>

		<h2>How they help?</h2>
		<p>Drones can be used to collect data related to crop yields, livestock health, 
		soil quality, nutrient measurements, weather and rainfall results, and more. 
		This data can then be used to get a more accurate map of any existing issues, 
		as well as create solutions based upon extremely reliable data.</p>
		<br><br>
		Various drones have varied purposes but the main general areas of focus of agriculture drones are listed below.
		<ol>
			<h3><li>Soil and Field Analysis:</h3>By obtaining 3D maps of existing soil, you’ll be able to see if there are 
				any issues surrounding soil quality, nutrient management, or soil dead zones.
				This information can help determine the most effective patterns for 
				planting, managing crops, soil, and more. 
				Ongoing monitoring can help to better utilize water resources, and more 
				effectively manage crop nutrient levels.</li>
			<h3><li>Seed Planting:</h3>Drone planting is a relatively newer technology and not as widely used.
				This helps to minimize the need for on-the-ground planting, 
				which can be costly, time-intensive, and strenuous work.</li>
			<h3><li>Crop Spraying:</h3>Drones can be equipped with large reservoirs, which can be filled with 
				fertilizers, herbicides, or pesticides and sprayed on the farm. 
				It much safer and cost-effective.
				For example, if there’s a fungus breakout in a certain section of the crops, 
				drones can be used to spot-treat the issue. 
				With the speed at which drones can operate, you can diagnose and treat 
				potential crop issues before they become a widespread issue across the 
				entire farm.<br>
				<strong>As per the provisions of Insecticides Act 1968, drone-spraying 
				(application of pesticides) is illegal in India without an approval 
				from the Central Insecticides Board (CIB).

			<h3><li>Crop Mapping and Surveying:</h3>
				<img class="image" src="../../../../../images/drones_thermal_imaging.jpg" style="margin-top:0px;float:right;width:400px;height:300px;" alt="drone thermal imaging">
				With near infrared (NIR) drone sensors you can actually determine plant 
				health based upon light absorption, giving you a birds-eye view of the 
				overall farm health.</li>
			<h3><li>Irrigation Monitoring and Management:</h3>Drones that are equipped with thermal cameras can help to spot irrigation 
				issues, or areas that are receiving too little or excessive moisture. 
				With this information, crops can be better laid out to ensure proper irrigation.</li>
			<h3><li>Real-time Livestock Monitoring:</h3>Drones equipped with thermal imaging cameras can monitor livestock with 
				less time and staff investment. 
				The drone operator can quickly check in on the herd to see if there are any 
				injured or missing livestock, as well as see the livestock that are giving
				birth. Plus, they help in keeping an eye out for any livestock predators.</li>
		</ol>
		
		<h2>Cost?</h2>
		Agriculture drones range from Rs. 3,00,000 to Rs. 10,00,000 based on capacity and requirement.

		<h2>Did You Know?</h2>
		<ol style="padding-left:10px;">
			<li>In India, there are over 35 drone start-ups that are working to raise the technological standards and reduce the prices of agriculture drones.</li>
			<li>In December 2018, the Indian government launched a drone policy, which allows for the agricultural application of drones.</li>
			<li>The agricultural drone market is expected to grow over 38% in coming years.</li>
